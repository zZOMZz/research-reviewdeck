# Split Guidance

Use this reference only when the basic rules in `SKILL.md` are not enough.

## Goal

Split a large PR diff into a sequence of smaller, logically coherent sub-patches that are easier to review.

## Principles

- Pattern-aware ordering: choose a review flow that matches the user's preference or the diff shape
- Cohesive grouping: keep tightly related changes together, and separate unrelated concerns when doing so improves reviewability
- Stable review flow: order groups so a reviewer can build context without jumping back and forth unnecessarily
- Reviewer-oriented descriptions: describe why this group exists in the review flow, not just the touched area
- Co-review drafts when warranted: if you notice a concrete review concern while splitting, attach it as a draft comment instead of switching into a full review report

## Review patterns

Use one of these patterns when ordering groups:

- `deps-first`: review prerequisites before dependents so later groups do not rely on unseen context. This is the default when the user does not express a preference.
- `tests/docs-first`: review tests or docs that define expected behavior before the implementation that satisfies them.

## Pattern selection

Use these heuristics:

- If the user names a preferred flow, follow it.
- If the prompt has no clear preference and asking would help, briefly offer `deps-first` and `tests/docs-first`.
- If the user does not choose, continue with `deps-first`.
- Prefer `tests/docs-first` only when the tests or docs materially clarify expected behavior or review intent.
- Fall back to `deps-first` when tests are trivial, purely mechanical, or depend on too much unseen implementation detail.

## Output format

Output a single JSON object with no markdown fences and no extra commentary:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "description": "Add version selector plumbing so later upgrade flows have a stable input",
      "changes": ["0-2", 5, 6],
      "draftComments": [
        {
          "change": 6,
          "body": "Check whether the new selector can drift out of sync when no compatible versions exist."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Cover the upgrade path with e2e checks after the UI flow is in place",
      "changes": ["3-4", "7-9"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rules

1. Every change index must appear in exactly one group.
2. No index may appear in more than one group.
3. No index may be omitted.
4. Groups are ordered. Group 1 is reviewed first, group N last.
5. Choose the number of groups based on the PR shape. Use as many groups as needed to keep the review understandable, but avoid splitting tightly coupled changes just to create more groups.
6. Use range syntax for consecutive indices: `"0-2"` means `[0, 1, 2]`.
7. `draftComments` is optional.
8. Each draft comment must anchor to a `change` that belongs to the same group.

## Description guidance

Good descriptions help a reviewer understand why this group should be reviewed as one unit and how it fits into the sequence.

Prefer descriptions that:

- explain the intent or review value of the group
- mention the dependency or sequencing reason when useful
- tell the reviewer what they can learn or verify in this step

Avoid descriptions that are only:

- a raw area label like `form version selector`
- an as-is restatement of filenames, component names, or ticket labels
- too vague to distinguish this group from adjacent ones

Examples that usually work well:

- `Add version selection plumbing so the upgrade flow has a stable entry point`
- `Show current version and status before wiring upgrade actions`
- `Isolate the upgrade dialog and action handling as the main behavior change`
- `Add e2e coverage once the upgrade flow is in place`

Examples that are often too vague:

- `version selector`
- `status display`
- `upgrade dialog`
- `e2e`

## Draft comment guidance

Use `draftComments` selectively. They are candidate review comments that the human reviewer can accept or reject during `render`.

Prefer draft comments that:

- point to a specific risk, regression, or questionable assumption
- are anchored to one concrete indexed change
- read like something worth sending to the source review if accepted

Avoid draft comments that are only:

- a summary of what the code does
- generic praise or noise
- a vague warning with no concrete concern

Examples that usually work well:

- `Potential regression: this update path bypasses the sanitizing transform used by the normal edit flow.`
- `This selector keeps the old version when no compatible options exist, so the form may submit an unavailable version.`

Examples that are often too weak:

- `Adds selector logic`
- `Looks risky`
- `Need review`
